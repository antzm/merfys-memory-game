# Merfys Memory Game

This is a memory game to test how good you are at remembering things.

It consists of 16 cards (8 pairs) and your purpose is to match all the cards, in the least amount of time, with the least amount of moves!

If you play this game once, and you successfully manage to match all the cards, then you are granted permission to have a look "behind the screen" and see how the code of this game looks like.

And if you would like to use this code, or just a part of it (for something you would like to create), then please pay attention to the terms of the **"Merfys Pet License"** mentioned below:

_Merfys thinking about the terms of the "Merfys Pet License"..._

Terms of license: This code can be freely used under the **"Merfys Pet License"**. As you can see, Merfys is a dog, so the main term of the license is that you are respectful towards dogs, cats and any other pet, either if you have one or not.

Sounds strange, but if you love pets and respect them, chances are that you would also respect other people, and in this case, people who write code, and so you will use their code, with respect towards everyone of them, with respect towards you, and also with respect towards the pets you care about.

_Let a pet in your life be proud of who you are!_
